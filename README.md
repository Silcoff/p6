This reposotory is a fork from the original AR4 controller reposotory



In the folder CAD you will find the models for the manipulator.


in the folder home style code you will find the code used for the tests.

**Features:**

- Moveit control (GUI and Python interface example)
- Gazebo simulation


This is a refresh of [ar3_core](https://github.com/ongdexter/ar3_core).

## Arduino cli

  ```bash
arduino-cli compile FILENAME -b teensy:avr:teensy41
  ```



upload teensy
  ```bash
arduino-cli upload FILENAME -p usb1/1-7 -b teensy:avr:teensy41
  ```

serial for terminal
  ```bash
arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/ttyACM0 -b teensy:avr:teensy41
  ```

check what ports are used
  ```bash
arduino-cli board list
  ```


## Overview

- **ar_description**
  - Hardware description of arm & servo gripper urdf.
- **ar_hardware_interface**
  - ROS interfaces for the arm and servo gripper drivers, built on the ros2_control framework.
  - Manages joint offsets, limits and conversion between joint and actuator messages.
  - Handles communication with the microcontrollers.
- **ar_microcontrollers**
  - Firmware for the microcontrollers, ie. Teensy and Arduino Nano.
- **ar_moveit_config**
  - MoveIt module for motion planning.
  - Controlling the arm and servo gripper through Rviz.
- **ar_gazebo**
  - Simulation on Gazebo.

## Installation

- Install [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for Ubuntu 22.04
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Silcoff/p6
  ```
- Install workspace dependencies:
  ```bash
  rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
  ```
- Build the workspace:
  ```bash
  colcon build
  ```
- Source the workspace:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Enable serial port access if you haven't already done so:
  ```bash
  sudo addgroup $USER dialout
  ```
  You will need to log out and back in for changes to take effect.

### Firmware Flashing

The Teensy and Arduino Nano sketches provided in [ar_microcontrollers](./ar_microcontrollers/)
are compatible with the default hardware. To flash the teensy, use the arduino IDE.  

### [Optional] Running in Docker Container

A docker container and run script has been provided that can be used to run the
robot and any GUI programs. It requires an NVIDIA GPU, and the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html)
to be installed. Then you can start the docker container with:

```bash
docker build -t ar4_ros_driver .
./run_in_docker.sh
```

## Usage

There are two modules that you will always need to run:

1. **Arm module** - this can be for either a real-world or simulated arm

   - For controlling the real-world arm, you will need to run the `ar_hardware_interface` module
   - For the simulated arm, you will need to run the `ar_gazebo` module
   - Either of the modules will load the necessary hardware descriptions for MoveIt

2. **MoveIt module** - the `ar_moveit_config` module provides the MoveIt interface and RViz GUI.

The various use cases of the modules and instructions to run them are described below:

---

### MoveIt Demo in RViz

If you are unfamiliar with MoveIt, it is recommended to start with this to explore planning with MoveIt in RViz. This contains neither a real-world nor a simulated arm but just a model loaded within RViz for visualisation.

The robot description, moveit interface and RViz will all be loaded in the single demo launch file

```bash
ros2 launch ar_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```

---

### Control real-world arm with MoveIt in RViz

Start the `ar_hardware_interface` module, which will load configs and the robot description:

```bash
ros2 launch ar_hardware_interface ar_hardware.launch.py \
  calibrate:=True
```

Available Launch Arguments:

- `ar_model`: The model of the AR4. Options are `ar4` (which includes MK2) or `ar4_mk3`. Defaults to `ar4`.
- `calibrate`: Whether to calibrate the robot arm (determine the absolute position
  of each joint).
- `include_gripper`: Whether to include the servo gripper. Defaults to: `include_gripper:=True`.
- `serial_port`: Serial port of the Teensy board. Defaults to: `serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM0`.
- `arduino_serial_port`: Serial port of the Arduino Nano board. Defaults to `arduino_serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0`.

‚ö†Ô∏èüìè Note: Calibration is required after flashing firmware to the Teensy board, and
power cycling the robot and/or the Teensy board. It can be skipped in subsequent
runs with `calibrate:=False`.

Start MoveIt and RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch ar_moveit_config ar_moveit.launch.py
```

Available Launch Arguments:

- `ar_model`: The model of the AR4. Options are `ar4` (which includes MK2) or `ar4_mk3`. Defaults to `ar4`.
- `include_gripper`: Whether to include the servo gripper. Defaults to:
  `include_gripper:=True`.
- `use_sim_time`: Make Moveit use simulation time. Should only be enabled when
  running with Gazebo. Defaults to: `use_sim_time:=False`.

You can now plan in RViz and control the real-world arm. Joint commands and joint states will be updated through the hardware interface.

---

### Control simulated arm in Gazebo with MoveIt in RViz

Start the `ar_gazebo` module, which will start the Gazebo simulator and load the robot description:

```bash
ros2 launch ar_gazebo ar_gazebo.launch.py
```

Start Moveit and RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch ar_moveit_config ar_moveit.launch.py use_sim_time:=true include_gripper:=True
```

You can now plan in RViz and control the simulated arm.
