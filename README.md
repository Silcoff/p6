# AR4 ROS Driver

ROS 2 driver of the AR4 robot arm from [Annin Robotics](https://www.anninrobotics.com).
Tested with ROS 2 Iron on Ubuntu 22.04. This is a refresh of
[ar3_core](https://github.com/ongdexter/ar3_core).

## Overview

- **ar_description**
  - Hardware description of arm, urdf etc.
- **ar_hardware_interface**
  - ROS interface for the hardware driver, built on the ros2_control framework
  - Manages joint offsets, limits and conversion between joint and actuator messages
- **ar_hardware_driver**
  - Handles communication with the motor controllers
- **ar_microcontrollers**
  - Firmware for the motor controller ie. Teensy
- **ar_moveit_config**
  - MoveIt module for motion planning
  - Controlling the arm through Rviz
- **ar_gazebo**
  - Simulation on Gazebo
- **ar_control** (Work in progress)
  - Controlling the arm through the MoveIt user interfaces
  - Provides demo for the move group interface

## Installation

- Install [ROS 2 Iron](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation.html) for Ubuntu 22.04
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ycheng517/ar4_ros_driver
  ```
- Install workspace dependencies:
  ```bash
  rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
  ```
- Build the workspace:
  ```bash
  colcon build
  ```
- Source the workspace:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Enable serial port access if you haven't already done so:
  ```bash
  sudo addgroup $USER dialout
  ```
  You will need to log out and back in for changes to take effect.

### Firmware Flashing

The Teensy Arduino sketch provided in [ar_microcontrollers](./ar_microcontrollers/)
is compatible with the default hardware. To flash it, follow the same
procedure as specified in [AR4 Robot Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6lXu8VU4s).

### Running in Docker Container

A docker container and run script has been provided that can be used to run the
robot and any GUI programs. It requires an NVIDIA GPU, and the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html)
to be installed. Then you can start the docker container with:

```bash
docker build -t ar4_ros_driver .
./run_in_docker.sh
```

## Usage

There are two modules that you will always need to run:

1. **Arm module** - this can be for either a real-world or simulated arm

   - For controlling the real-world arm, you will need to run the `ar_hardware_interface` module
   - For the simulated arm, you will need to run the `ar_gazebo` module
   - Either of the modules will load the necessary hardware descriptions for MoveIt

2. **MoveIt module** - the `ar_moveit_config` module provides the MoveIt interface and RViz GUI, and the `ar_control` module provides the MoveIt user interface for programmatically setting goals

The various use cases of the modules and instructions to run them are described below:

---

### MoveIt Demo in RViz

If you are unfamiliar with MoveIt, it is recommended to start with this to explore planning with MoveIt in RViz. This contains neither a real-world nor a simulated arm but just a model loaded within RViz for visualisation.

- The robot description, moveit interface and RViz will all be loaded in the single demo launch file
  ```
  ros2 launch ar_moveit_config demo.launch.py
  ```

---

### Control real-world arm with MoveIt in RViz

Start the `ar_hardware_interface` module, which will load configs and the robot description:

```bash
ros2 launch ar_hardware_interface ar_hardware.launch.py \
  calibrate:=True
```

Notes:

- Calibration is required after flashing firmware to the Teensy board, and
  power cycling the robot and/or the Teensy board. It can be skipped in subsequent
  runs with `calibrate:=False`.
- Serial port of the Teensy board can be specified with the following launch
  argument: `serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM0`.

Start MoveIt and RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch ar_moveit_config ar_moveit.launch.py
```

You can now plan in RViz and control the real-world arm. Joint commands and joint states will be updated through the hardware interface.

---

### Control simulated arm in Gazebo with MoveIt in RViz

- Start the `ar_gazebo` module, which will start the Gazebo simulator and load the robot description
  ```
  ros2 launch ar_gazebo ar_gazebo.launch.py
  ```
- Start Moveit and RViz
  ```
  ros2 launch ar_moveit_config ar_moveit.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
  ```
  You can now plan in RViz and control the simulated arm.

---

### ðŸš§ Work in Progress: Control arm with Move Group Interface

**It is recommended to run this demo with the simulated arm first to make sure that the programmed goals are safe for your environment (and your arm). Needless to say, the same applies when programming your own tasks.**

This is a demo modified from the official MoveIt tutorials. As opposed to manually setting goals through RViz, the move group interface allows us to programmatically plan and execute movements, and provides more functionality such as specifying path constraints and planning Cartesian movements. This also enables much more complex tasks, planning around obstacles etc.

- Start the `ar_gazebo` module, which will start the Gazebo simulator and load the robot description  
  _For controlling the real-world arm, you will just need to run `ar_hardware_interface` instead of `ar_gazebo` as described above._
  ```
  ros2 launch ar_gazebo ar_gazebo_bringup.launch
  ```
- Start Moveit and RViz
  ```
  ros2 launch ar_moveit_config ar_moveit_bringup.launch
  ```
- Start the move group demo
  ```
  ros2 launch ar_control move_group_demo.launch
  ```
  Follow the command-line instructions to step through the demo. See `ar_control` for more details.
